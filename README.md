Cypress
=========

Cypress is an open source software tool that verifies the implementation of the Stage 1 Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Measures.

Quality Measures
----------------

This web application leverages the [Quality Measure Engine](https://github.com/pophealth/quality-measure-engine) library to calculate quality measures. An implementation of the [Stage 1 MU CQM needed to meet Stage 1 Meaningful Use requirements](http://www.cms.gov/QualityMeasures/03_ElectronicSpecifications.asp) is available in the [Measures Project](https://github.com/pophealth/measures).

Project Practices
=================

Please try to follow our [Coding Style Guides](http://github.com/eedrummer/styleguide). Additionally, we will be using git in a pattern similar to [Vincent Driessen's workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). While feature branches are encouraged, they are not required to work on the project.
