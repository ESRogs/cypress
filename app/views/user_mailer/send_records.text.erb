Hello <%= @vendor.poc %>,

Attached are patient records designed by Cypress to test <%= @product.name %> for accurate Stage 1 Clinical Quality Measure calculation. If you have received this e-mail in error, feel free to discard it. All of the included patients are made entirely of synthetic data, which were provided by the American Medical Association, and do not contain any protected health information.

Please import these records into your system and calculate the relevant measures. To complete the test, reply to <%= @test.proctor %> via this e-mail with your results in the form of a PQRI report, as specified by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They will use that file for scoring in Cypress and can inform you of the results.

Cypress is an open source project developed by The MITRE Corporation and is intended to expedite repeated CQM testing but does not provide official Stage 1 certification. If you have any questions about the project specifically, you can visit our website at http://www.projectcypress.org/ or contact us at project-cypress-talk@googlegroups.com.

Thank you very much,
The Cypress Team
