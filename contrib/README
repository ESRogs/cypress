Cypress Contributed files
=========================

The things in this directory are not directly a part of the Cypress
application.  However, they do offer some utility in conjunction with the
Cypress application, but there wasn't another good place to stash them.
This README file describes each file in this directory, and what it does.

README: The file you are reading now.

install_cypress.sh: This is a bash shell script designed for a completely
       hands-off installation of Cypress and all dependencies on an Ubuntu
       linux system. The script was developed and tested on the 12.04 LTS
       64-bit server edition of Ubuntu, but should work on later versions as
       well.
