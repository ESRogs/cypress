Cypress Contributed files
=========================

The things in this directory are not directly a part of the Cypress
application.  However, they do offer some utility in conjunction with the
Cypress application, but there wasn't another good place to stash them.
This README file describes each file in this directory, and what it does.

README: The file you are reading now.

install_cypress.sh: This is a bash shell script designed for a completely
       hands-off installation of Cypress and all dependencies on an Ubuntu
       linux system. The script was developed and tested on the 12.04 LTS
       64-bit server edition of Ubuntu, but should work on later versions as
       well. As of October 1, 2014, the script has been tested on both Ubuntu 
       12.04 snd 14.04 LTS.

cypress.json: This is a Packer script designed to generate Virtualbox, VMWare,
	   and Amazon virtual machines in conjunction with the Packer utility. 
	   Syntax is `packer build -only=<vms_to_build_by_name_comma_delim> cypress.json`,
	   or `packer build -except=<vms_to_not_build> cypress.json`. For Amazon AWS
	   builds, access and secret key need to be defined as environment variables
	   AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY, respectively. Be aware that you will
	   be charged for any AWS instance time, as the minimum size to build the AWS
	   version of the VM is `t2.small`.
